# Jet Cabinet Pressure Detection System Using STM32F103C6

## Overview
The Jet Cabinet Pressure Detection System is designed to monitor and respond to various pressure levels within a jet cabinet.<br>
The system uses an STM32F103C6 MCU to process the input from a pressure sensor and activate an alarm system consisting of three LEDs,<br>
depending on the detected pressure levels. Additionally, the system logs the pressure values into flash memory for later review.

## Case Study
The system operates under the following conditions:

**Green LED**: Activated when the pressure is below 10 bars.<br>
**Yellow LED**: Activated when the pressure is between 10-20 bars.<br>
**Red LED**: Activated when the pressure is above 20 bars.<br>
